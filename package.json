    "description": "AWS CloudFormation AWS CloudFormation allows you to create and manage AWS\ninfrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. You can use AWS\nCloudFormation to leverage AWS products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud,\nAmazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon Simple Notification Service, Elastic Load\nBalancing, and Auto Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable,\ncost-effective applications without creating or configuring the underlying AWS\ninfrastructure.\n\nWith AWS CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and dependencies in a\ntemplate file. The template defines a collection of resources as a single unit\ncalled a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of\nthe stack together and manages all dependencies between the resources for you.\n\nFor more information about AWS CloudFormation, see the AWS CloudFormation\nProduct Page [http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/].\n\nAmazon CloudFormation makes use of other AWS products. If you need additional\ntechnical information about a specific AWS product, you can find the product's\ntechnical documentation at docs.aws.amazon.com [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/].",
